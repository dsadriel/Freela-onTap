### ðŸ§± Architecture

This project follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture:

- **Model**: Handles the data and business logic.
- **View**: Manages the UI and presentation layer.
- **Controller**: Acts as the intermediary between Model and View, processing user input and updating the Model or View accordingly.

This separation promotes better organization, scalability, and maintainability of the codebase.
